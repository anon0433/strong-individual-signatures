Supplementary Code for Double-Blind Review

Shiny App code is also provided. The app will not run without the correct directory structure and image files, which could not be uploaded to GitHub at this time. However, the full directory structure (including spectrogram image files) can be made available upon request, and will be made publicly available if and when the manuscript is accepted. The password can be found on line 25 of global.R.
